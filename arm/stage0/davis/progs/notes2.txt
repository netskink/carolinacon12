Problem #1
syscall shows two forms for syscalls. One uses r0, r1, etc.  The other
uses a1.  Either way, the assembly op codes for arm are risc like
and register use 0x0.  Here is the opcodes for a mov instruction:

e3a00001 -> mov r0, #1.

If you encode this in the buffer, strcpy will truncate the 
buffer as soon as it sees a 0x00.  :-/
